# Green Economy

The role of Green Economy, Sustainable Consumption and Production and Resource Efficiency for Sustainable Development: 

Sustainable Consumption and Production aims to improve production processes and consumption practices to reduce resource consumption, waste generation and emissions across the full life cycle of processes and products â€“ while Resource Efficiency refers to the ways in which resources are used to deliver value to society and aims to reduce the amount of resources needed, and emissions and waste generated, per unit of product or service. 

The Green Economy provides a macroeconomic approach to sustainable economic growth with a central focus on investments, employment and skills.

# Collection and Pressing

The pressing of waste paper after the collection phase plays a crucial role in preparing the paper for the subsequent stages of the recycling process. Here's why:

Compaction: The pressing process helps to compact the collected paper waste, making it easier to handle and transport. This is especially important when dealing with large quantities of paper, as it reduces the space required for storage and transportation, thereby saving on resources.

Removal of Excess Air: During the collection process, paper waste often includes a significant amount of air. Pressing the paper can help to remove this excess air, which can improve the efficiency of the subsequent processing stages. This is particularly important in the pulping stage, where the paper is broken down into a slurry of fibers. Having too much air in the pulp can make this process more difficult and less efficient.

# Telegram Bot 

Connecting a Telegram bot to a Google Sheet can be done using Google Apps Script. This allows the bot to interact with the sheet, reading and writing data to it. Here's a brief explanation of how this can be done:

Setting up the Telegram Bot: First, you need to create a bot on Telegram. This can be done by talking to the BotFather on Telegram. The BotFather will provide you with a token, which is needed to interact with your bot.

Setting up Google Apps Script: Next, you need to create a new Google Apps Script. This script will be used to interact with the Telegram bot and the Google Sheet. The script will need to be deployed as a web application, which will provide a URL that can be used to receive updates from the bot.

Connecting the Bot to the Script: The Google Apps Script will need to be connected to the Telegram bot. This is done by using the bot token provided by the BotFather. The script will also need to specify the ID of the Google Sheet it will be interacting with.

Interacting with the Google Sheet: Once the bot and the Google Apps Script are connected, the script can start interacting with the Google Sheet. This can involve reading data from the sheet, writing data to the sheet, or both. The exact actions will depend on the requirements of your bot.

# Google Spreadsheet 

Google Sheets can be used as a basic database for small to medium-sized projects. It allows you to store, sort, and filter data, and even perform calculations with built-in functions. It also supports real-time collaboration, so multiple users can work on the same spreadsheet simultaneously.

You can use Google Sheets as a database for a wide range of tasks, from tracking inventory for a small business to managing a personal budget. It can store customer information, track inventory levels, and monitor sales data for an e-commerce store. You can also use it to track income and expenses, set financial goals, and monitor progress toward those goals.

# Google App Script 

Google Apps Script is a cloud-based scripting platform developed by Google. It allows you to write scripts that integrate with Google Workspace, including Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Sheets. You can use Google Apps Script to automate tasks, build web applications, and extend the functionality of Google Workspace.

You write scripts in JavaScript and have access to built-in libraries for Google Workspace applications. Google Apps Script runs on Google's servers, so you don't need to worry about setting up a server or managing data access permissions.

Google Apps Script is part of Google Workspace and is available to everyone with a Gmail account, so no additional software or services are required to start using it.

Google Apps Script can be used to create a wide variety of applications, from simple scripts to complex web applications. For example, you can use it to create a mail merge using Gmail and Sheets, analyze sentiment of open-ended feedback, or even build a chatbot.
