# Green agenda

Paper recycling is a process that involves the reuse of paper products that would otherwise be discarded. The process contributes to reducing waste and conserving natural resources, which aligns with the green agenda. 
Sorting: The collected paper is then sorted by type. Some recycling facilities may be able to handle mixed paper, while others may require the paper to be separated into different categories (such as newsprint, cardstock, and corrugated).
