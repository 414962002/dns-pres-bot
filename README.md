# Green Economy

The role of Green Economy, Sustainable Consumption and Production and Resource Efficiency for Sustainable Development: 

Sustainable Consumption and Production aims to improve production processes and consumption practices to reduce resource consumption, waste generation and emissions across the full life cycle of processes and products â€“ while Resource Efficiency refers to the ways in which resources are used to deliver value to society and aims to reduce the amount of resources needed, and emissions and waste generated, per unit of product or service. 

The Green Economy provides a macroeconomic approach to sustainable economic growth with a central focus on investments, employment and skills.

# Collection & Pressing

The pressing of waste paper after the collection phase plays a crucial role in preparing the paper for the subsequent stages of the recycling process. Here's why:

Compaction: The pressing process helps to compact the collected paper waste, making it easier to handle and transport. This is especially important when dealing with large quantities of paper, as it reduces the space required for storage and transportation, thereby saving on resources.

Removal of Excess Air: During the collection process, paper waste often includes a significant amount of air. Pressing the paper can help to remove this excess air, which can improve the efficiency of the subsequent processing stages. This is particularly important in the pulping stage, where the paper is broken down into a slurry of fibers. Having too much air in the pulp can make this process more difficult and less efficient.
